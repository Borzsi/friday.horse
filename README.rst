============

Patches are welcome. Wanted, even.

Commit messages should preferably include the word "horse" or "horsy".

Garbage code that is fun is also welcome. Obviously.

More horse pictures are welcome, but licenses matter. All horse pictures
in the repo right now were declared free for use _without_ attribution. If
you want to add an image requiring attribution you also need to supply code
to support showing that attribution. I suggest a simple array of pictures,
including an attribution string and a url (must be internal).
